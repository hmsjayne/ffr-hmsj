# Final Fantasy: HMS Jayne

Final Fantasy: HMS Jayne is a proof of concept randomizer Final Fantasy I: Dawn of Souls for the Nintendo Gameboy Advance.

## Key Features

* Start the game with the Airship!
* Key Item shuffle
* Magic level shuffle
* Shuffled treasure

## Key Items and NPCs

A "key" feature of this randomizer is that while NPCs are moved around, the item they give you is always the same.

For example, imagine you walk into Cornelia Castle and see that the "King of Cornelia" is Smyth the Dwarf. This means:

* To get Smyth's item, you'll need to rescue the NPC kidnapped by Garland in Chaos Shrine.
* The item you'll get in return for rescuing them is [Excalibur][Excalibur].

We feel this provides a fun opportunity to decide whether or not to attempt certain dungeons, allowing for more strategic play.

While it's not possible to know what's in Marsh Cave before opening the chest, you could take a peek in Western Keep or Matoya's Cave to decide whether to bring the Crown or Crystal Eye back ASAP, or if those locations are duds.
